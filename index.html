        <p >I am YK Prakash ( Koti Prakash Yallapragada), an Instrumentation engineer from BITS, Pilani
           having 35 years of experience in the field of customer support for  imported Analytical 
           instruments used by Chemists. Micro Controllers, Photography and Astrology are my hobbies.</p>

          <p>My exposure to astrology started in 2003. During 2014-16, I had done a two years part-time course called 
          Jyotish Visarada at Jyotirvasthu Vignana Samstha. But for that, my astrology is mostly 
          self learned through books and studying charts. Mr KN Rao is my inspiration.</p>
          
          <p>The first question that crosses the mind of an Indian parent, whenever a marriage 
          proposal springs up is - How many points?. Ashta-Kootami, a Guna Melapakam program 
          tries to address that need. There are many such alternatives available on the net. 
          The speciality of this program is-</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Asks for minimal data. Just select the star and pada of the pair.</li>
          <li>Works on mobile too.</li>
          <li>Gives detailed split up of the eight different kootamis.</li>
          <li> Explains each kootami and exceptions proposed by various experts.</li>
          <li>Explains my way of analysis of these kootamis - My Method.</li>
          <li>Suggests if matching of given stars exists - My Method. </li>
          <li>Lists suitable stars for a Girl or a Boy - My Method.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A few requests to help find the birth star and paada, given the birth details, resulted 
            in the program called Horscope. This is not a full fledged astrology program. It can not show
            retro or vakri state of planets. A great freeware alternative called Jagannatha Hora is 
            available else where for that.</p>
