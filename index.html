        <p >I am YK Prakash ( Koti Prakash Yallapragada), an Instrumentation engineer from BITS,Pilani
           having 35 years of experience in the field of customer support for  imported Analytical 
           instruments used by Analytical Chemists.</p>

          <p>My exposure to astrology started in 2003. During 2014-16, I had done a two years part-time course called 
          Jyotish Visarada at Jyotirvasthu Vignana Samstha. But for that, my astrology is mostly 
          self learned through books and studying charts.</p>
          
          <p>The first question that crosses the mind of an Indian parent, whenever a marriage 
          proposal springs up is - How many points?. Ashta-Kootami, a Guna Melapakam program 
          tries to address that need. There are many such alternatives available on the net. 
          The speciality of this program is-</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Asks for minimal data. Just select the star and pada of the pair.</li>
          <li>Works on mobile too.</li>
          <li>Gives detailed split up of the eight different kootamis.</li>
          <li> Explains each kootami and exceptions proposed by various experts.</li>
          <li>Explains  how I prefer to look at the issue - My Method.</li>
          <li>Proposes a method of analysis for matching - My Method. </li>
          <li>Lists suitable stars for a Girl or a Boy - My Method.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A few requests to help find the birth star and paada, given the birth details, resulted 
            in the program called Horscope. This is not a full fledged astrology program. A great 
            freeware alternative called Jagannatha Hora is available else where for that.</p>
