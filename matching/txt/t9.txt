<h2>Guna-Melapakam - Total Points</h2><hr>
<p> Minimum 18 or more points out of a total of 36 are suggested for a proper match. Still, one has to check exceptions and special rules. For example,
even if more than 18 points are shown, if the stars of the girl and boy have mutual vedha, that match is not recommended. Normally same rasi or same nakshatra
matches yield lot of points. But one has to decide if one wants to acccept same nakshatra matches.</p>
