<h2>Varna Kootami</h2><hr>

<p>
Starting from Meena Rasi, each rasi is allotted one of the four Varnas - Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya, Soodra. <br><br>
Girl must not be of a higher Varna than the boy.<br>If same Varna or if Boy's Varna is higher - one point. Else Zero points.<br><br>

<p><span class = "minahaa">Exceptions: Muhurtha Sindhu ( Jyotirnibandham):</span></p>
<p> Even if this kootami gives zero points, one can check  Varna Kootami as per Varnas of the lords of the Rasis.  For this purspose, Ravi and Kuja are Kshatriyas, Guru and Sukra are Brahmins, Chandra and Budha are Vysyas and Sani is Soodra.</p>

<p><b>Another Method(Muhurtha Darpanam):</b><br>

Meena, Vruschika,Karkataka = Bramhana; Simha, Dhanus, Tula = Kshatriya; Mesha, Midhuna, Kumbha = Vysya; Vrshabha, Makara, Kanya = Soodra. Dr BV Raman gave this only. </p>
