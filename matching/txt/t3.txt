<h2>Dina or Taaraa Kootami</h2><hr>
<p>Tara Balam simply counts how far one star is from another. When you count from a star, the same star is Janma Tara, second one is Sampath Tara,
third one is Vipath Tara, fourth one is Kshema Tara, fifth one is Pratyak Tara, sixth one is Saadhana Tara, seventh one is Naidhana or Vadha tara, eigth one is Mitra Tara and ninth one is Parama Mitra tara. After nine stars, the Cycle rpeats. Thus, the total twenty seven stars are divided in to three cycles of 9 stars called Navakams. </p>
<p>As per Poorva Kalamrutham - From the Girl's star if  the boy's star is 2/4/6/8 it is OK. Else bad.</p>

<p>As per Muhurtha Darpanam - From the Girl's star if  the boy's star is 2/4/6/8/9 it is OK. Else bad.</p>

<p>As per Muhurtha Sindhu ( Daivagna Manoharam) of Irnaganti Rangacharya -  - 3,5,7 Tara is bad. Must check from both sides. If ok from both sides, 3 points. If ok from one side only, 1.5 points, else zero points.</p>

<p></b> As per Prashna Marga  - From the Girl's star if  the boy's star is 3/5/7 it is bad. 5th tara is very bad. Acceptable if Sthree Deergham exists.</p>

<p><b>Mahaa Nakshatras:</b><br>
Gayatri Vasudev( Kaala Vidhaana): swati, mrugasira, makha, anooradha - do not require matching.<br>
Note: Mr SC Kursija mentioned exception from Tara Kootami only for these maha nakshatras.<br></p>

<p><b>Dushta Nakshatras:</b><br>
BV Raman: As per tradition, some stars have dosha - Moola-1. Aslesha-1, Jyeshta-1 , Visakha-4.<br>
Note: As this was said to be applicable to girl's stars only, it shows discrimination against women and hence not acceptable now a days.<br></p>


<p><b>Sthree Dergham:</b> <br>
This is the count that shows how far away is boy's star from that of the girl's.<br>
Exception: Rasi kootami or graha maitri  exists, no need to see this.<br><br></p>

<p><b>Mahendram:</b><br>
From the girl's star, if the boy's star is  4,7,10,13,16,19,22,25  - then it's auspicious. Please not that  7, 16, 25- become naidhana Taras.  Also note that as per Kaala Prakasika, 22nd star called Vainasika is also not auspicious. 
<br> Dr BV Raman says that - in his experience, 22nd to 27th stars are not so in-auspicious.<br><br></p>

<p><b>Vedha Stars:</b> <br>
See Table of Vedha Stars under Special Topics. Some pairs of stars are said to be in-auspicious.<br><br></p>

<p><b>Vadha Stars:</b><br>
Please see Table of Vadha Stars, in special topics link.<br>
Vadha tara means naidhana tara only. For same stars, the seventh star or naidhana tara can be accepted.<br><br></p>

<p><b>27th Star:</b><br>
BV Raman: From the girl's, the boy's star should not be 27th. If the boy's star happens to be Revati, there is an exception.<br>
SC Kursija: In such a case, if it is same Rasi, then it is oK. But, even if same rasi, these pairs are not acceptable:  bharani boy and kruttika girl; pushyami boy and aslesha girl; dhanishta boy and satabhisha girl.<br><br></p>
