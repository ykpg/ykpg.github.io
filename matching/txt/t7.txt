<h2>Bha or Rasi Kootami </h2><hr>
It measures how far one rasi is from another.<br><br>
<p><b>Muhurta Sindhu: </b><br>
    1. In case of Same rasi and Nakshatra, at least the padam must be different. Same rasi and different nakshatra is preferred. Vara's nakshatra should preccede that of the girl;'s. same nakshatra and different rasi are average matches. <br>
    2. 2/12 axis of rasis is acceptable only if mutual freindship of rasi lords exists. <br>
    3. 3/11 axis of rasis is always acceptable.<br>
    4.  4/10 axis of rasis is also good.<br>
    5. 5/9 axis of rasis is acceptable only if mutual freindship of rasi lords exists. <br>
    6. 6/8 axis of rasis is acceptable only if mutual freindship of rasi lords exists. <br>
	7. Sama Saptakam is good, except for simha-kumbha and karakataka-Makara pairs.<br><br>

<b>BV Raman: </b><br>
if mutual freindship of rasi lords exists, this dosha gets reduced significantly.<br>
No 6/8 axis dosham if the Rasi of the girl is odd. If the girl's Rasi is even, there is no 2/12 axis dosha.  No need to see graha maitri if the mutual rasis are in 3/11 axis or 4/10 axis or Sama Saptakam.<br></p>
